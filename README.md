Plant Disease Classifier

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying plant diseases using computer vision. The model is based on a ResNet9 architecture and has been trained on a dataset comprising various plant disease images. The accompanying Streamlit web app allows users to upload images for real-time disease prediction.

Key Features:

- ResNet9 architecture for image classification
- Training script for model development
- Streamlit web app for user-friendly image classification
- Model evaluation and optimization techniques implemented
- Confidence threshold for filtering predictions

Explore the world of plant disease identification and contribute to the development of more robust models for agricultural applications.
